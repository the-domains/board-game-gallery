# The Art of Board Games

When I peruse bottles of hot sauce, bottles of wine, coffee, books, or nearly anything that brings me tangible joy, a product's aesthetic is nearly always the first thing to draw me in.

And this is also true of my relentless passion, board games. As I scan Kickstarter ads, the shelves of my local game store, or browse pages of games from online retailers, it's the cover art that has the power to stop me in my tracks. Forget game descriptions for a moment. Forget the genre. Forget the mechanics. I am drawn by what I can see.

How does your board game look, and by extension, how does it feel?

This website is a place celebrate the art of board games. Welcome to Board Game Gallery.

> Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. -- Pablo Picasso
